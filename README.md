# C# OOP AutoBattler
## About
Project involving OOP principles, made for the OOP course for the second year of study. I chose this project because game design using oop usually includes additional logic and more principles then we were thought at the course.
## Features
The game is a functional autobattler where you chose your heroes and after the round begins, they fight the enemies in each level. The main gameplay loop is simple, level up heros, purchase upgrades and use iteams to make your heroes stronger, fight and progress through levels until you lose.
